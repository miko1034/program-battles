BlockBattles!


This is a project which I've started a couple months ago but I have decided to try and improve the code and hopefully maybe even finish the project! It is meant to be a simulation of multiple blocks that choose on their own if they want to attack each other, grow in size or do nothing and wait.

It would probably be much easier and much more beneficial to learn neural networking and rewrite the project then, but well I am just not that advanced yet.. but I am working on it! :)
